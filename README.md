# Hardened Ubuntu Setup for Namada Node

This repository contains security hardening scripts for Ubuntu systems running Namada blockchain nodes.

## ðŸš¨ Important: /tmp Directory Considerations

**CRITICAL**: When hardening `/tmp` with `noexec` option, it breaks Rust compilation and many build tools that need to execute temporary binaries. This solution addresses this by:

- **Keeping `/tmp` executable** but with `nosuid,nodev` for security
- **Creating a separate `/build` directory** for compilation with proper permissions  
- **Configuring Rust environment variables** to use the secure build directory
- **Using `/var/tmp` with `noexec`** for general temporary files that don't need execution

##  Repository Contents

- **Process restrictions** - Limits ptrace and file operations

### Network Security
- **UFW Firewall** - Configures restrictive firewall rules
- **Fail2ban** - Prevents brute force attacks
- **SSH Hardening** - Disables root login, password auth, X11 forwarding
- **Network isolation** - Disables IP forwarding and unnecessary protocols

### Filesystem Security
- **Secure mount options** - Applies `nosuid,nodev` where appropriate
- **Build environment isolation** - Separate `/build` directory for compilation
- **File integrity monitoring** - AIDE for detecting unauthorized changes
- **Directory permissions** - Restricts access to sensitive directories

### Service Hardening
- **Disable unnecessary services** - Removes attack surface
- **Systemd service security** - Applies security restrictions to Namada service
- **Resource limits** - Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Logging configuration** - Comprehensive audit trail

### User Management
- **Namadaoperator user** - Dedicated admin user with sudo privileges
- **Service user separation** - Namada runs as dedicated service user
- **SSH access control** - Restricted to namadaoperator user only
- **Privilege separation** - No root access needed for daily operations

##  Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS installation
- User with sudo privileges
- Internet connection
- Minimum 8GB RAM, 100GB storage

### 2. Run Complete Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone or download the scripts
cd /path/to/namada-code

# Run the complete setup (hardening + build env + Namada)
./install.sh
```

### Alternative: Manual Step-by-Step
```bash
# Option 1: Run individual scripts in order
./harden-ubuntu.sh
./setup-build-env.sh
./install-namada.sh

# Option 2: Run the master script
./setup-hardened-namada.sh
```

##  Detailed Usage

### Hardening Script (`harden-ubuntu.sh`)
The main hardening script performs the following operations:

1. **System Updates** - Updates packages and configures automatic updates
2. **Kernel Hardening** - Applies security kernel parameters
3. **Network Security** - Configures firewall and fail2ban
4. **SSH Hardening** - Secures SSH configuration

8. **Monitoring Setup** - Configures logging and monitoring
9. **Automation** - Sets up cron jobs for maintenance

### Build Environment Script (`setup-build-env.sh`)
Sets up a secure build environment that addresses the `/tmp` execution issue:

1. **Creates `/build` directory** - Secure location for compilation
2. **Configures Rust environment** - Sets up CARGO_HOME, RUSTUP_HOME, etc.
3. **Build isolation** - Scripts for running builds in isolated environment
4. **Cleanup automation** - Automatic cleanup of build artifacts
5. **Monitoring** - Scripts to monitor build environment health

### Namada Installation Script (`install-namada.sh`)
Securely installs and configures Namada:

1. **Downloads latest Namada** - Fetches from official GitHub releases
2. **Secure installation** - Installs with proper permissions
3. **Service configuration** - Creates systemd service with security restrictions
4. **Logging setup** - Configures comprehensive logging
5. **Management scripts** - Creates scripts for node management
